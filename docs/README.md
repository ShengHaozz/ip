# Bob User Guide

Bob is a desktop chatbot that helps you keep track of todos, deadlines, and events using short text commands.

## Quick start

1. Launch Bob.
2. Type a command in the input box.
3. Press **Enter** or click **Run**.

Bob saves your tasks automatically. When Bob starts, it shows the tasks loaded from storage and the number of
invalid stored tasks that were skipped.

> **Date format:** Use `dd/MM/yy HH:mm` in 24-hour time. For example, `21/09/26 18:30` means
> 21 September 2026 at 6:30 PM.

## Command summary

| Action | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Add a todo | `todo DESCRIPTION` |
| Add a deadline | `deadline DESCRIPTION /by DATE_TIME` |
| Add an event | `event DESCRIPTION /from DATE_TIME /to DATE_TIME` |
| Show all tasks | `list` |
| Find tasks | `find KEYWORD` |
| Mark a task as done | `mark INDEX` |
| Mark a task as not done | `unmark INDEX` |
| Delete a task | `delete INDEX` |
| Update a task | `update INDEX FLAG VALUE [FLAG VALUE]...` |
| Exit Bob | `bye` |

## Adding tasks

### Todo

Use a todo for a task without a date or time.

```text
todo read chapter 3
```

### Deadline

Use a deadline for a task that must be completed by a specific time.

```text
deadline submit report /by 21/09/26 18:30
```

### Event

Use an event for an activity with a start and end time. The end must not be earlier than the start.

```text
event project meeting /from 22/09/26 14:00 /to 22/09/26 15:30
```

## Viewing and finding tasks

Use `list` to display every task and its index:

```text
list
```

Use `find` to show tasks whose descriptions contain a keyword. Matching is case-insensitive.

```text
find report
```

## Completing, reopening, and deleting tasks

Use the index shown by `list` or `find`:

```text
mark 2
unmark 2
delete 2
```

Task indices can change after a deletion, so run `list` again when unsure.

## Updating tasks

Use one or more update flags in any order:

| Flag | Updates |
| --- | --- |
| `/desc DESCRIPTION` | Task description |
| `/by DATE_TIME` | Deadline time |
| `/from DATE_TIME` | Event start time |
| `/to DATE_TIME` | Event end time |

Examples:

```text
update 1 /desc read chapters 3 and 4
update 2 /by 23/09/26 20:00 /desc submit final report
update 3 /from 24/09/26 09:30 /to 24/09/26 11:00
```

Only flags that apply to the task type are accepted:

- Todos support `/desc`.
- Deadlines support `/desc` and `/by`.
- Events support `/desc`, `/from`, and `/to`.

## Exiting

Use the following command to close Bob safely:

```text
bye
```
